# Project: Secure Remote Office Infrastructure
**Environment:** Hyper-V | **Firewall:** pfSense | **Monitoring:** Splunk

## Project Objective
To build and defend a virtualized enterprise network that follows the **Principle of Least Privilege**. This lab demonstrates my ability to configure firewalls, segment networks, and analyze traffic logs.

## Technical Architecture
*(Diagram Coming Tomorrow)*

## Security Hardening Implemented
- [ ] pfSense Gateway Configuration
- [ ] Network Segmentation (Internal vs. External Switches)
- [ ] Firewall Rule Optimization (Blocking ICMP, Port Hardening)
- [ ] Centralized Logging via Splunk SIEM
- [ ] Network Discovery & Vulnerability Scanning via **Nmap**

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network Administration & Infrastructure
- Firewall Management (L3/L4 Rules)
- SIEM Integration & Log Analysis
- Threat Discovery (Nmap)
